  Handmade Balance Bike Project
      
  The main purpose of this project is to build a simple e-commerce website for handmade balance bikes.
All products are completely handcrafted by me - the author of this project (Stanislav Yanakiev).
It is my hobby and I put a lot of efforts and love when making these products as well as making this project. 
The balance bike is a small wooden(in my case) bicycle with no pedals, also known as push bikes.
The product develops the balance and coordination of the child, which make the transition to a regular bicycle very smooth and effortless.

  The website is intended for Bulgarian market. The payment method is Cash On Delivery (COD) – most used and desirable from customers.
